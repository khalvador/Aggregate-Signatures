abstract="In this chapter we describe some of the recent progress in lattice-based cryptography. Lattice-based cryptographic constructions hold a great promise for post-quantum cryptography, as they enjoy very strong security proofs based on worst-case hardness, relatively efficient implementations, as well as great simplicity. In addition, lattice-based cryptography is believed to be secure against quantum computers. Our focus here will be mainly on the practical aspects of lattice-based cryptography and less on the methods used to establish their security. For other surveys on the topic of lattice-based cryptography, see, e.g., [36, 52, 60, 71] and the lecture notes [51, 67]. The survey by Nguyen and Stern [60] also describes some applications of lattices in cryptanalysis, an important topic that we do not discuss here. Another useful resource is the book by Micciancio and Goldwasser [49], which also contains a wealth of information on the computational complexity aspects of lattice problems.",

Applications of SNARKs often involve proving computations that include the SNARK verifier, a technique called recursive composition. Unfortunately, SNARKs with desirable features such as a transparent (public-coin) setup are known only in the random oracle model (ROM). In applications this oracle must be heuristically instantiated and used in a non-black-box way.},
